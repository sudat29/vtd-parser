# VTD-XML Parser Project

## Overview
The VTD-XML Parser is a high-performance, memory-efficient XML parsing library built using the VTD-XML technology. This project aims to provide an intuitive API for developers to easily parse and query large XML documents while maintaining a minimal memory footprint.

## Features
- **Memory Efficiency**: Utilizes VTD-XML's memory-mapped approach to minimize heap usage.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for processing large XML documents (500MB+) with fast XPath query execution.
- **Intuitive API**: Provides a clean and developer-friendly interface for XML parsing and querying.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implements robust exception handling to manage various error scenarios gracefully.
- **Extensible Design**: Built with future enhancements in mind, allowing for easy integration of new features.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main components:

- **src/main/java/com/vtdparser**: Contains the core implementation of the VTD-XML parser.
- **src/test/java/com/vtdparser**: Includes unit and integration tests to ensure the parser's functionality and performance.
- **src/main/resources**: Holds configuration properties and other resource files.
- **doc**: Contains documentation files, including implementation plans, API documentation, performance benchmarks, usage examples, and migration guides.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vtd-parser
   ```

2. **Build the Project**: 
   Use Gradle to build the project.
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **Run Tests**: 
   Execute the test suite to verify the implementation.
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

4. **Documentation**: 
   Refer to the `doc` folder for detailed documentation on API usage, performance benchmarks, and migration guides.

## Implementation Plan
A detailed step-by-step implementation plan is documented in the `doc/implementation-plan.md` file. This plan outlines the tasks, timelines, and responsibilities for the development of the VTD-XML parser.
