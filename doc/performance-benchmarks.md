# Performance Benchmarks for VTD-XML Parser

## Introduction
This document outlines the performance benchmarks for the VTD-XML parser implementation. The benchmarks focus on measuring the parser's efficiency in terms of memory usage and processing speed when handling large XML documents.

## Benchmarking Environment
- **Hardware Specifications**:
  - CPU: Intel Core i7-9700K
  - RAM: 32 GB
  - Disk: SSD with high read/write speeds

- **Software Specifications**:
  - Java Version: OpenJDK 11
  - VTD-XML Version: [Specify the version used]
  - Operating System: [Specify the OS, e.g., Windows 10, Ubuntu 20.04]

## Benchmarking Methodology
1. **Test Data**: 
   - Use XML documents of varying sizes (10MB, 100MB, 500MB, 1GB) for testing.
   - Include both well-formed and malformed XML documents to assess error handling.

2. **Metrics Collected**:
   - **Memory Usage**: Measure the heap memory consumption during parsing.
   - **Processing Time**: Record the time taken to execute various parsing operations (e.g., searching, retrieving values).
   - **Throughput**: Calculate the number of documents processed per minute.

3. **Tools Used**:
   - Java VisualVM for memory profiling.
   - JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) for accurate timing of parsing operations.

## Benchmark Results

### Throughput
| Document Size | Documents Processed/Minute |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| 10 MB         | [Insert value]              |
| 100 MB        | [Insert value]              |
| 500 MB        | [Insert value]              |
| 1 GB          | [Insert value]              |
